# ChatGPT-Monkey-Flip
An experiment in using ChatGPT for code creation.

Over 90% of the code in this project was written by ChatGPT, all I did was tell it what was wrong, suggestions and sometimes when it simply could not figure it out, do a small edit.

My conclusion now that it's finished is that ChatGPT is scary even if for now it isn't that powerful (this took way longer that it would have if I made it myself, but still was worryingly fast).
