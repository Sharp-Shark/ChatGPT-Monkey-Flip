# ChatGPT-Monkey-Flip
An experiment in using ChatGPT for code creation.

>90% of the code in this project was written by ChatGPT, all I did was tell it what was wrong, suggestions and sometimes when it simply could not figure it out, do a small edit.

My conclusion now that it's finished is that ChatGPT is scary O-O
